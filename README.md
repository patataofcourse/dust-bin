# dust.bin
A tool for viewing and editing Nintendo 3DS particle effect files.

## Versions supported
* Version 11 / 0xB (Mario Kart 7)
* Version 51 / 0x33 (Rhythm Heaven Megamix)

If you can find any .ptcl file that can't be opened in dust.bin, DM me (patataofcourse#5556 on Discord) or open an issue, and I'll try to add support!

Alternatively, if you find that any other version/game works perfectly in dust.bin, let me know, too!
